diagram, consisting of text boxes. This can be used as a rapid starting point for
diagrams. 

The resulting file can be imported into a diagram at www.diagram.ly.

See example page [here](http://miebach.github.com/diagram-textbox-wizard/).

Each line will become a textbox in the resulting diagram. 

You can also create multiple boxes on one line by separating them with commas.
